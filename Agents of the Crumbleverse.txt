Agents of the Crumbleverse
Forge your agentic-hero biscuit to take on the dreaded Mind Crumble
This workshop invites participants to step into a playful, narrative-driven world where 
biscuits become adventurers in a Fantasy-RPG-inspired activity. Each team creates an 
AI-powered �biscuit agent� in Copilot Studio, giving it unique stats, personality, and 
flavour-based abilities. Together, these agents face a formidable villain�the Mind 
Crumble, a hive of broken crumbs that seeks to drain creativity and individuality from 
the biscuit realm.
The battle unfolds using a simple combat system, built with Power Automate. The aim 
- Teams combine their biscuit agents� abilities to overcome the Mind Crumble and 
restore individuality to the world.

The adventure party is a team of biscuits made of the following characters and classes:

*	Viennese Whirl = Wizard (ancient magic) 
*	Chocolate HobNob = Barbarian (oaty rage) 
*	Bourbon = Rogue (dark and stealthy) 
*	Custard Cream = Cleric (sweet healer) 
*	Jammie Dodger = Bard (fruity charm) 
*	Chocolate Digestive = Fighter (solid and dependable) 

Each region divides into six teams - each team creates the agent for one of the biscuit 
characters. Ideally teams are around 5 people. We can have more than one team per 
biscuit if needed.
The meaning behind the narrative
This concept is more than a fun game. It symbolises:
*	The power of agentic systems: as diverse biscuit character classes - each with 
unique abilities - collaborate autonomously to overcome the dreaded Mind 
Crumble.
*	Creativity as resistance: The Mind Crumble represents homogeneity and loss of 
individuality. Defeating it mirrors the power of imagination and diversity in 
problem-solving. 
*	Storytelling as engagement: By framing technical tools (Copilot Studio, Power 
Automate) within a narrative, we make innovation accessible and exciting.
How it will work
1. Build the Agent Interface
*	The teams will use Copilot Studio to design a simple UI for each player�s biscuit 
agent.
*	Include:
o	An adaptive card character sheet with: Class, HP, Attack, Defense + 
name, background, profile pic and traits
o	A button that triggers their characters special attack or ability
o	Each biscuit has a specific attack or ability - 
o	Wizard (Viennese Whirl) - Arcane Waltz: Deals magical damage and 
weakens the Mind Crumble�s defences for the next round.  
o	Barbarian (Chocolate Hobnob) - Oaty Smash: Heavy physical damage, 
best for breaking through armour-like crust.  
o	Rogue (Bourbon) - Chocolate Shadow Strike: Sneaky attack that deals 
damage and protects the rogue.  
o	Cleric (Custard Cream) - Sweet Salvation: Heals allies and shields them 
from Mind Crumble�s psychic crumb attacks.  
o	Bard (Jammie Dodger) - Jam Anthem: Buffs allies� attack rolls for the next 
round.
o	Fighter (Chocolate Digestive) - Shield of Sweet Steel: The Fighter 
hardens its chocolate coating into an impenetrable shield, then charges 
forward with biscuit-breaking force.
*	The different teams must combine all attacks and abilities to defeat the Mind 
Crumble
2. Connect to Shared Data Source
*	Store all agent and villain data in Dataverse or a SharePoint list.
*	Each agent record includes player stats; MindCrumble is a single record with a 
large HP pool.
3. Configure the Attack Button
*	In Power Apps:
o	Add a button control.
o	Set its OnSelect property to trigger a Power Automate flow.
?	OnSelect = PowerAutomateFlow.Run(PlayerID, AttackStats)
o	This passes the player�s ID and attack stats to the flow.
4. Power Automate Flow
*	Triggered by the button click.
*	Performs:
o	Attack or Ability based on the character type
o	For Attacks: Updates MindCrumble�s HP in the shared data source.
o	For Abilities: Updates other character stats
o	Sends real-time updates to Teams or Power BI dashboard.
5. Real-Time Feedback
*	Use adaptive cards in Teams or a Power BI live dashboard so everyone sees HP 
changes and attack logs instantly.
*	Cards in Teams or a Power BI live dashboard so everyone sees HP changes and 
attack logs instantly
Combat System Design
Core Principles:
*	Turn based: players wait in a queue for their turn to trigger their attack or ability
o	The Mind Crumble takes a turn after each player
*	Stats: Each biscuit agent has HP, Attack, and Defence. 
*	Actions: Players have one Attack or Ability (one per turn). 
*	Mind Crumble: Pre-made villain with HP and an attack that hits all players. 
*	Win Condition: Mind Crumble is defeated after every player has acted at least 
once. 
Step 1: Player Flow
1.	Player creates their biscuit agent in Copilot Studio (HP, Attack, Defence, 
Ability/Attack).
*	Class abilities/attacks are pre-defined - the player must connect their agent to 
the corrent ability/attack 
2.	They join the game (they trigger a Power Automate flow to add them to the game 
when they�re ready). 
o	the order players join the game determines the order of player turns
?	Could we assign players an order ID when they join and that is their 
turn number?
3.	When it is the players turn they can trigger their Attack or Ability: 
*	Attack: Damage = Player Attack � Mind Crumble Defence. 
*	Ability: Apply a simple effect (e.g., +2 damage next turn, heal 5 HP).   
4.	Update Mind Crumble HP and player stats in a shared table (Dataverse or Excel). 
5.	Update player turn count to +1
